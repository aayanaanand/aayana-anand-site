      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm Aayana (she/her), and I'm a current freshman at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. I'm majoring in Informatics with a concentration in Life Sciences, but I hope to gain admission to the School of Information for fall 2023. This semester (winter 2023), I'm beginning positions as an SI 106 Instructional Aide and Research Assistant under Professor Barbara Ericson through the School of Information. I’m also an incoming Data Analyst Intern at Stryker for the 2023 summer, where I’ll be working in the Customer Intelligence BU Analytics Team at the Kalamazoo world headquarters.
      <br><br>
      I was born in Canada, but I've spent most of my life in Michigan. I’m a first generation American and daughter of South Asian immigrants, and my culture/life experiences have always shaped my work. It’s because of my identity and upbringing that I place an especially high value on diversity, equity, and inclusion in social spaces and workplaces.
      <br><br>
      My passion is leveraging data/technology/information for social good – using technical skills to gain insights about the world and subsequently use those insights to find solutions to problems. In the process, I aim to approach my work collaboratively, ethically, and with an agile mindset.
      <br><br>
      My experiences span many subjects/fields, from media production to data analysis to consulting. I’m particularly interested in biomedicine and bioinformatics, but I'm open to any sector and always excited to learn new things.
      <br><br>
      My favorite show is The Office U.S., my favorite singer is Taylor Swift, and my sun sign is Leo. Some of my favorite things to do in my freetime are hanging out with friends, writing, building tiny homes in The Sims 4, updating my Taylor Swift song rankings, and trying out new coffee shops on campus.
      <br><br>
      If you have any requests or inquiries, please don't hesitate to contact me. My information is at the bottom of this page.

      <h3>Technical</h3>
       <p>I've always been a problem-solver at heart. As a child, I frequently occupied my days with puzzles of all types, from classic jigsaw puzzles to “Garden Gridlock” on Wii Party for the classic 2006 console. Naturally, when I discovered code, I loved how I could approach it like I did puzzles, where each line of code equated to a piece of a bigger picture or desired solution. Using coding as a springboard, I began to explore technology careers – anything that involved the problem-solving aspect of programming. This led me to begin pursuing extracurriculars and enrolling in classes that fueled these interests. In 2021, after 6 years of learning/experience, I committed to UMich with plans to major in Computer Science. 
       <br><br>
       I continued with CS for a while, but I eventually became frustrated with feelings of stagnation. The content I was learning felt one-dimensional – I knew how to implement my learning while coding Euchre, but I had no idea on where to go from there. I didn’t feel like I was going anywhere meaningful. For the duration of time that I was a CS major, I felt like I was gradually locking myself into a career that didn’t suit my restless need to apply technology in an ever-evolving world.
       <br><br>
       In 2022, I decided to change direction and seek a major that more effectively combined my interests in coding/technology and problem solving. To make up for the computer science classes I was no longer taking, I enrolled in MOOCs to continue my learning. I eventually settled on the Informatics major. I love this major, because it applies technology to life science, something that is extremely useful in finding solutions to some of the biggest issues facing society today.
     </p>
      <h3>Creative</h3>
      <p>I’ve been writing for as long as I can remember. When I was 5, I wrote (and poorly illustrated) books about fictional female superheroes out of stapled construction paper. Now, I write short stories, prose, poetry, and I also journal daily. I find that writing helps me stay grounded, especially when life happens. Furthering this interest, I’ve become a podcast host for an intersectional feminist organization, What the F.
      <br><br>
      Being a creative individual has helped me hone my problem-solving, technical, and communicative skills – arguably more than any STEM class ever has. Technical classes have provided me with frameworks, algorithms, and coding experience, but it’s always been my creative edge that has enabled me to transform these skills into actionable building blocks to solve problems. It helps me communicate complicated ideas, break down large tasks, and continue seeing potential in a field that is often siloed and binary.

          <p class="description">I was a mentee in a cohort of GWC through the University of Michigan Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics. The program was broken into 2 semesters – In semester 1, we learned Python with an emphasis on data science, and in semester 2, we were put into groups with PhD mentors and completed a project with an assigned database using our skills. My team had survey data about Californians’ diets. At the end of the program, we formally presented our findings. This program stressed collaboration and acknowledging each others’ differences in order to make the most out of our technical skills. In addition to creating something really cool with code, I also understood the value of inclusivity and human-interaction in STEM. This program is what originally piqued my interest with data analysis.

          <p class="description">Myself and 2 friends ran this club in our junior and senior years of high school. Our mission was to educate our peers and local community about organ donation and the benefits of registering to be an organ donor. We frequently partnered with Donate Life Michigan and Beaumont Hospital. My official role was as Outreach Director, so my specific duties concerned reaching out to local businesses/sponsors, running our social media accounts, organizing outreach events (organ donor drives, speaker events, fundraisers), and publicizing those events. I also was responsible for general club duties, such as running meetings. Being a part of Lifeline allowed me to experience being in a leadership role and helped me understand the importance of prioritizing tasks, staying organized, and communicating effectively. It was greatly rewarding to educate others on an important topic and getting to learn alongside them as well.

          <p class="description">This self-paced, virtual, data analytics internship required me to deliver findings in the form of marketing recommendations for a simulated bicycle company based on their customer purchase data. To do so, I used Python, SQL, and Tableau to perform operations, create visualizations, and find patterns in this structured data. I compiled my findings into a formal presentation. Because this was self-paced, I had to rely on organization and time-management to complete tasks on time, since I didn’t have someone enforcing deadlines. In addition to advancing my technical skills in data cleaning and analysis, I gained self-discipline and valuable soft skills for my professional life ahead.

          <p class="description">To pursue my creative interests in college, I joined What the F. What the F is a student organization that educates the UMich campus and the community at large on intersectional feminism. We have several projects/initiatives, such as our magazines and educational events, but I’m involved in the Podblog (Podcast + Blog) team. I started as a member of the team in my freshman year and worked with 4 other members at the time. No podcast had been sustained in What the F up until that point, so we worked together to build a new podcast from the ground up. After being a member of the team for a year, I was promoted to Podblog Co-Director, my current position. In this position, I run weekly meetings with my team, delegate podcast/blog tasks, write episode outlines, coordinate recordings, and edit recordings using Adobe Premiere Pro. Additionally, I facilitate the What the F Blog on Wordpress. I contribute to and manage the blog site, including delegating blog posts and increasing website interaction by 20% from 2021 to 2022. In the time I’ve been a part of What the F, I’ve loved educating and learning about intersectional feminism in an inclusive campus environment.

          <p class="description">I was accepted to the virtual cohort for summer 2023 to consult for companies based in South Africa. Many of the mentors and interns were from Africa, but a handful were from Europe, Asia, South America, and of course, all across the US. This was one of the coolest parts about this internship – I got to learn from people with unique backgrounds and perspectives. I began with 2 weeks of training, “Consulting in the New Normal,” to learn about consulting principles, agile mindsets, the South African landscape, and teamwork. Then, I was placed into a team of 6 (5 students and 1 project mentor) to consult for 4WKS Coffee, a sustainable coffee company in Cape Town, and worked as 1 of 2 research leads. My roles involved supervising and delegating client and market research, developing consulting-style presentations, analyzing purchase and marketing data, and overseeing the final report for the client. Our final product was a thorough, agile market sizing solution that would help 4WKS achieve their 2023 sales goals. This internship furthered my interest in using data analysis to solve problems but added the components of stakeholder interaction, iterative project management, and agile leadership.

      <p id="key">* = Available on my Github (linked below)</p>
      <h3 class="subheads">Fun Run (2020)*</h3>
            <p>This project was completed by my friend and I in high school for AP Computer Science A using Java. Inspired by this scene from The Office, Fun Run (title inspired by S4 E1) is an obstacle game where the player dodges show-relevant obstacles (squirrels, alfredo, etc.). The project is coded using the Java language but is delivered using Greenfoot.</p>
        <h3 class="subheads">Spotify Data (2022)*</h3>
            <p>I find Spotify data to be one of the most interesting things to analyze, and it seems like many users agree (Spotify Wrapped is highly anticipated for a reason)! For my capstone project in the Python for Everybody specialization, I decided to use Python and SQL to make a simple program relating to my personal Spotify data as of April 2022. The program allows for the user to input an artist’s name and outputs information from my data pertaining to that artist. It also stores my data into SQL databases.</p>
         <h3 class="subheads">This Website (2022-Present)*</h3>
            <p>I created this website (as a continuation of the Web Development for Everybody capstone project) to demonstrate my web development skills and provide more detail on my professional work and career thus far. I intend to update this website as I obtain more opportunities, complete more projects, and advance in my career overall. I will continue to make sure that this website is as accessible and responsive for all screens as possible. I hope to refine this website with time as I get better with web development.</p>
         <h3 class="subheads">Never Lose a Footrest Again! (2021)</h3>
            <p>From volunteering at a group home in high school, I noticed an issue with wheelchairs being used in common areas. Oftentimes, wheelchairs don’t fit well through entries and doorways. I decided to do something about this by modifying the footrest design of wheelchairs. Normally, the footrests are stowed outward, but stowing them inward would allow for the width of the wheelchair to be reduced. I filed this as a design patent to the USPTO.</p>
         <h3 class="subheads">How Starbucks uses Technology to Trick Us All</h3>
            <p>This is a <a href="https://medium.com/@aayana/how-starbucks-uses-technology-to-fool-us-all-b216ddd29306">longform blog post</a> I wrote and published on Medium as a project for SI 110 in spring 2022, which earned a grade of 238/250. I wrote about the ways that Starbucks uses Information Science principles to “trick” customers and continue a positive feedback loop of customer interaction, which ultimately drives a significant portion of their success today.
